# TwitDirect

TwitDirect is an Android 8.0+ app to redirect embed-fixer links to their respective official apps, instead of going through the browser.

***Now supports more than just Twitter!***  
Tumblr and Bluesky embed-fixer links are now also supported!

We all know how Twitter embeds often don't work well, and don't look great.  
So services like [FxTwitter](https://github.com/FixTweet/FxTwitter) and [VxTwitter](https://github.com/dylanpdx/BetterTwitFix)
sprouted up as alternatives to the official Twitter embeds.  
If you have the official Twitter app installed, and you click a normal Twitter link, it opens in the app, like you would expect.  
However, when you click an improved embed link from one such 3rd party embed services, it opens into your browser, instead.  
This is due to the Twitter app not being registered to open those types of links.  
So to solve this, I made a small redirector app that seamlessly directly opens them in the official Twitter app.

This app was made in one evening, for one of my friends who uses the Twitter app a lot and was mildly miffed by this.
