	<string name="explanation">If you are running Android 12 or newer,
		you need to manually register the links that this app may open,
		due to privacy and security reasons.\nThis
		is not needed on older versions of Android, because there,
		whenever you click on a supported link, you will directly be offered an options menu
		with all apps that can open that type of link.\nYou
		can then choose whether you want to only [JustOnce] or [Always]
		open that type of link with that app.\nI
		recommend choosing to [Always] open Twitter redirect links with TwitDirect.</string>
	<string name="instruction">In the settings menu that this button opens,
		tap [+AddLink] and add every link you want to redirect.</string>
	<string name="button_text">Click me to go to the link settings!</string>
